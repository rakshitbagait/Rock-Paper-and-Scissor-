## 🧠 How It Works

* You choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors using GUI buttons.
* The computer randomly chooses its move.
* The game compares both choices and updates:

  * 🏆 Who won the round
  * 🔁 Scoreboard
  * ✨ Real-time messages

---

## 🔧 Code Highlights

* Uses `tk.Button`, `tk.Label`, and `tk.Canvas` for UI elements.
* `random.choice()` to simulate computer decision.
* Simple logic to decide winner:

  ```python
  if user == computer:
      result = "Tie!"
  elif (user == "rock" and computer == "scissors") or ...
      result = "You Win!"
  ```

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Add sound effects or animations 🎵
* Include a best-of-5 or timer mode ⏱️
